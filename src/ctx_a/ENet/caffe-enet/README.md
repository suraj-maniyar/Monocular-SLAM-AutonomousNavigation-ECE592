# Caffe-ENet
**This is a modified version of [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) which supports the [ENet architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02147).**

It comes as a fork of [Caffe-SegNet-cuDNN5](https://github.com/TimoSaemann/caffe-segnet-cudnn5) with a slightly adapted dense-image-data-layer and a new layer: spatial dropout (python layer).

Credit: Alex Kendall for his [caffe-segnet](https://github.com/alexgkendall/caffe-segnet) repository, which is the basis for this. 

## How to use it
Please find a tutorial on how to use it in the [ENet](https://github.com/TimoSaemann/ENet) repository.
