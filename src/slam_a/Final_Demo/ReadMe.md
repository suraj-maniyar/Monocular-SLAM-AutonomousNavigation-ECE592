VINS-Mono: A Robust and Versatile Monocular Visual-Inertial State Estimator [1]

Takes in Visual and Odometry data from a calibrated pinhole camera (Raspberry Camera) and a 9-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (BNO055)

Methodology:

Open two separate terminals, launch the vins_estimator, and rviz repectively by issuing the following commands:


roslaunch vins_estimator slam_a.launch
roslaunch vins_estimator vins_rviz.launch

We can even run without having the extrinsic parameters between camera and IMU. We will calibrate them online. Replace the first command with:
roslaunch vins_estimator slam_a_no_extrinsic_param.launch
